# whats-above-me

This is the code repository for my astronomy dashboard, whats-above-me. It's a website that queries various astronomy-related data sources and coalesces them to form a dashboard about stargazing that's tailored to the user's location. It's made using Flask, JQuery, Bootstrap, and basic HTML/CSS/JS. Live URL TBA.
